# Herbrand

## Jack's Notes

From looking through / thinking this afternoon, this seems like a (non-complete) list of things to do:

- Update intro / bibliography to acknowledge anything relevant published since 2014
- In the very last proof, the proof by induction of one direction of Herbrand's Theorem (2.7 Theorem 1 part ii) I remember handwaving over one of the steps because I didn't know how to do it. Looking back, I think it's part c (Simplification: If ϕ∨ϕ 0 has a tautological expansion then ϕ has a tautological expansion, where ϕ 0 is an alphabetical variant of ϕ). Probably best to revisit this and say something less blaggy.
- There are a couple of places where I omit proofs that are given elsewhere (e.g. Theorem 2(ii)(b) - the bit that Herband got wrong and Dreben corrected). I'm not sure how much we should add these in - I think it's probably okay seeing as the main point of this paper is to tidy up and make clearer the overall proof rather than to exhaustively go over every detail. But we can discuss.


Some additional nice-to-have things that I seem to remember Alex Paseau suggesting:
- More signposting early on about the structure of the proof and the purpose of all of the parts of Chapter 2 (although sort of have this in 2.3)
- A table to show equivalences between Herbrand's original terms and my terms (I seem to remember his are all quite vague like Property A and mine are hopefully more self-explanatory)
